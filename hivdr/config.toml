# Parameters explained:
#
# wait:                 If true, introduces a brief 0.3-second pause between file selection and CSV results generation.
#                       This program executes very quickly, and in some cases, an instant response can seem suspiciously fast,
#                       especially to users unfamiliar with how lightweight the analysis is. This may create the impression that
#                       no real processing has occurred.
#                       
#                       Introducing a short delay can help reassure users that their input has been registered and thoughtfully
#                       handled. Thereâ€™s some anecdotal evidence that intentional pauses can increase perceived value and credibility.
#                       See this article for more context:

#
# division:             "vhf" = positive or negative for one target per well based on Cq (i.e., Ebola or Marburg, but not both)
#                       "hiv" = positive or negative for all targets in well based on copy number extrapolated from Cq; requires standard curve on plate
#
# cq_cutoff:            If a well's cycle is "Undetermined," it will be assigned the value of cq_cutoff - the maximum possible Cq value.
#
# pos_cutoff:           Wells with a Cq above this value are considered negative for that target.
#
# dRn_percent_cutoff:   Regardless of Cq, if a well's dRn is below this fraction of the max dRn on the plate, it is considered negative.
#                       Example: max FAM dRn of any well on the plate is 100,000. Well A1 has a FAM dRn of 4,500 and a FAM Cq of 28.
#                                pos_cutoff = 30, dRn_percent_cutoff = 0.05
#                                Despite a Cq below pos_cutoff, A1 is considered negative for FAM, because 4,500 is less than 5% of 100,000.
